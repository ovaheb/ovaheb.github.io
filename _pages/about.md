Hi there! I'm an Applied Scientist and Engineer who loves solving tricky real-world problems. My journey started with Electrical and Computer Engineering, and I quickly found myself diving deep into AI. I thrive on tackling challenges, optimizing systems, and pushing the boundaries of what AI can do.

Right now, I'm working at REDspace, making Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) more accurate and reliable. I also collaborate with the amazing folks at the Vector Institute. My adventures include working on cutting-edge astronomical imaging at the University of Toronto and National Research Council Canada. Back at the University of Tehran, I explored the intersection of AI and healthcare, developing deep learning models for biomedical applications like Autism detection from infants' crying audio. Basically, if it involves AI, data, and making things better—I'm all in!

When I'm not buried in code, you'll probably find me geeking out over 3D printing, binge-watching a great series, or getting way too invested in a soccer match (whether it's playing, watching, or crushing my friends in FIFA)!
